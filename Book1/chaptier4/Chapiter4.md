# Chapter 4: The Bigger Picture
### Pillar 1: Scope and Closure

The paragraph discusses the importance of scope and closure in programming languages, particularly in JavaScript (JS). Scopes are like buckets that contain variables, and the scope model determines which variables are accessible based on their nesting levels. JS follows lexical scope, where scope boundaries and variable organization are determined during compilation. The paragraph addresses two characteristics of JS that make some people question its lexical scope: hoisting and function-scoped var declarations. However, these characteristics do not invalidate lexical scoping. The paragraph also mentions the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ), a behavior specific to let/const declarations. Closure, which arises from lexical scope and the use of functions as first-class values, allows functions to maintain access to variables from their original scope, even when executed in different scopes. Closure plays a significant role in various programming patterns, including modules. For more information on scope, closures, and modules, the recommendation is to read Book 2, Scope & Closures.

### Pillar 2: Prototypes
The paragraph introduces the second pillar of the language, which is the prototypes system in JavaScript (JS). It mentions that JS allows the creation of objects directly without the need for defining their structure in a class, distinguishing it from many other languages. The paragraph acknowledges that the class design pattern has been implemented on top of prototypes in JS, but it suggests that the beauty and power of the prototype system have been overshadowed by the focus on classes. The ability for objects to dynamically connect and cooperate through sharing a this context is highlighted as a significant advantage of the prototype system. The paragraph advocates for embracing objects as objects and utilizing behavior delegation as a powerful means of organizing behavior and data, rather than relying solely on class inheritance. It expresses a desire for more exploration and consideration of delegation as a viable alternative to classes and functional programming. The recommendation is to delve into Book 3, Objects & Classes, to gain a deeper understanding of the potential of object delegation. Finally, it suggests that object delegation aligns more naturally with the nature of JS compared to classes.

### Pillar 3: Types and Coercion

The paragraph discusses the third pillar of JavaScript (JS), which is types and coercion. It acknowledges that this aspect of JS is often overlooked and misunderstood by developers. It mentions the growing interest in static typing approaches, such as TypeScript or Flow, within the JS community. While acknowledging the value of learning about types and type-aware tooling, the paragraph disagrees with the notion that JS's type mechanism is inherently flawed and needs to be supplemented by external solutions. It suggests that there are alternative options available that align more naturally with JS. The paragraph emphasizes the importance of understanding JS's value types and the conversion (coercion) of values between types, stating that no JS program can be useful without leveraging these aspects properly. It advises developers, even those who favor TypeScript/Flow, to gain a deep familiarity with how the language itself handles value types. The recommendation is to explore Book 4, Types & Grammar, to learn more about JS types and coercion. Lastly, it stresses that neglecting this pillar leaves one's foundation in JS weak and incomplete.

### With the Grain
The paragraph emphasizes the importance of understanding and aligning with the grain of JavaScript (JS) while navigating through the learning journey and applying JS concepts. It acknowledges that the books in the series go against the traditional approaches to JS and provide comprehensive explanations of the language. The paragraph encourages readers to think independently and analyze what works best in their own code, even if it means standing out from the crowd. While the information in the books aims to be accurate, it also includes the author's opinions on interpreting and utilizing JS effectively. The paragraph advises readers to verify facts from the official specification and not be discouraged if their opinions differ from others. It emphasizes owning and defending personal opinions and being prepared to walk away from situations where there is a fundamental disagreement. On the other hand, it suggests following the grain of how JS works at the language level and embracing JS patterns and idioms. The paragraph also stresses the importance of introducing changes gradually in existing projects and building consensus with fellow developers based on evidence and analysis rather than adhering to existing practices out of inertia. Ultimately, the advice encourages continuous improvement in code readability and acknowledges the value it brings to the entire development team.

### In Order
The paragraph provides guidance on the recommended order for reading the book series. The suggested order is as follows:

1. Start with "Get Started" (Book 1) to establish a solid foundation in JavaScript (JS).

2. Proceed to "Scope & Closures" (Book 2) to delve into the first pillar of JS, which covers lexical scope, closure, and the module pattern.

3. Continue with "Objects & Classes" (Book 3) to focus on the second pillar of JS, which explores how "this" works, the role of object prototypes in delegation, and how prototypes facilitate the class mechanism.

4. Move on to "Types & Grammar" (Book 4) to tackle the third pillar of JS, which encompasses types, type coercion, and the syntax and grammar of the language.

5. After the three pillars are well-understood, proceed to "Sync & Async" (Book 5), which explores flow control and modeling state change in programs synchronously and asynchronously.

6. Conclude the series with "ES.Next & Beyond" (Book 6), which offers insights into the near- and mid-term future of JS and introduces upcoming features.

Although Books 2, 3, and 4 can be read in any order based on personal interest, it is recommended not to skip any of them, including "Types & Grammar."

"Sync & Async" (Book 5) is considered crucial for a deep understanding of JS, but if it appears overwhelming, it can be deferred until gaining more experience with the language.

"ES.Next & Beyond" (Book 6) can be read either at the end or right after "Get Started" to expand one's knowledge of JS. It may receive future updates, so revisiting it periodically is suggested.

The paragraph emphasizes the importance of practicing coding and encourages readers to explore the appendices, particularly practicing the snippets in Appendix B, to enhance their learning experience.
